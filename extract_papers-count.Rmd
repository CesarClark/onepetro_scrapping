    (?= results.)  positive lookahead. match anything that is followed by " results."
 
```

```{r}
pattern <- "[\\d,]+(?= results.)"
regexpr(pattern, x, perl = TRUE)
```

```{r}
m <- regexpr(pattern, x, perl = TRUE)

regmatches(x, m)

# this will remove the comma
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", regmatches(x, m)))
